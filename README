Unlike the ideal possible with pure software development, this process is far from completely automated.

Songs are developed in Rosegarden, using tools found in morashon/py.  All the songs are presently in separate folders in the morashon repo.

Song mixes are exported from Rosegarden using jack and timemachine, typically called ruf_blah_commit.wav

Dialogue is developed in scene directories in morashon/dialogue -- see the ./mak scripts.

Songs and dialogue are imported into the ardour projects in each segment repo (seg1 - seg5)

Segment mixes are exported in ardour, end up in segX/export/

Dialogue for the textMovie (py scripts in morashon/textMovie) are in segX.txt files; see ./mak in each segment, produces segX.avi

morashon/mix/meta/mak combines the 5 segX.avi's into morashon.avi


It sucks yet works (to quote an old friend, "SUCKS; GREAT!")
